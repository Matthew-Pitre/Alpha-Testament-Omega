		- `preventScroll` is a convenient way to have both vertical drag and vertical scrolling coexist. Note that scroll will always have precedence over drag. To drag vertically the user will have to press and hold the draggable area for  `250ms`  (or the specified duration) without moving. After this duration, the element is draggable and scrolling is prevented. Note that if you drag horizontally the scroll will immediately be prevented without waiting for this duration.
