- Struggling Electron quit unexpectedly for Logseq development
	- There is an issue on Mac, starting probably early this week that Logseq running in electron dev mode immediate crashes after running with  `yarn dev-electron-app` . In the crash report, it prompts an error   `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid))`   in the crash report. Any ideas on how to fix this?
	- The error is gone after I remove the `/static` dir and rebuild. But the error is back after restarting

		- But I did not even know where is the Electron app

	- Logseq did change [codesigning in GitHub action](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/6522/files), however seems not related
	- Restarting with `electron-forge start --inspect-electron --enable-logging`
	- `bootstrap_look_up com.deeplink.logseq.MachPortRendezvousServer.45931: Permission denied (1100)`
		- this throws at every first full-rebuild run. What is it?
