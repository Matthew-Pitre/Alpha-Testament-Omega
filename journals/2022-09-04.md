- Electron quit unexpectedly.
	- There is an issue on Mac, starting probably early this week that Logseq running in electron dev mode immediate crashes after running with  `yarn dev-electron-app` . In the crash report, it prompts an error   `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid))`   in the crash report. Any ideas on how to fix this?
