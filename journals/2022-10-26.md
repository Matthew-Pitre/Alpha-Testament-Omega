		- New routing system
		- By default, components inside  `app`  are [React Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components). This is a performance optimization and allows you to easily adopt them. However, you can also use [Client Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#client-components).
		- Special routes
			- [**page.tsx**](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/pages-and-layouts#pages): A file used to define the unique UI of a route. Pages represent the leaf of the route and are needed for the path to be accessible.
			- [**layout.tsx**](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts): A file used to define UI that is shared across multiple pages. A layout accepts another layout or a page as its child. You can nest layouts to create nested routes.
			- [**loading.tsx**](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/loading-ui): An optional file used to create loading UI for a specific part of an app. It automatically wraps a page or child layout in a [React Suspense Boundary](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/Suspense#suspense), showing your loading component immediately on the first load and when navigating between sibling routes.
			- [**error.tsx**](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/error): An optional file used to isolate errors to specific parts of an app, show specific error information, and functionality to attempt to recover from the error. It automatically wraps a page or child layout in a [React Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html). Showing your error component whenever an error in a subtree is caught.
			- [**template.tsx**](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/pages-and-layouts#templates): An optional file, similar to layouts, but on navigation, a new instance of the component is mounted and the state is not shared. You can use templates for cases where you require their behavior, such as enter/exit animations.
			- [**head.tsx**](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/pages-and-layouts#modifying-head): An optional file used to define the contents of the  `<head>`  tag for a given route.
