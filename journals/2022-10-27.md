			- See https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/app-directory-roadmap#caveats
				- Support for  `.md`  and  `.mdx`  files requires importing them from a Server Component (e.g.  `app/page.js`  imports  `app/blog.md` ). If using MDX,  `next.config.js`  would also require using the corresponding plugin.

	- Next.js can be configured through a  `next.config.js`  file in the root of your project directory.
		- meaning, no need to use next-transpile-modules
		- https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js#
	- API route is not yet supported, but listed in the [roadmap](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/app-directory-roadmap)
	- Next.js is now TS by default

		- tried this, but failed
		- It seems Nextjs is using a different React version than the explicitly declared one
		- and this version does not provide `React.createContext`??? https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/41929
		- Turns out that server components cannot use context
	- Provided a new font module, but it seems it is JS only and I don't know if there is a good way to define font-face with that easily somehow.
