- Google Keybinding `KeyHandler`seems stopropagation for sequencial keybindings
	- e.g., `t t` will stop `t` even if the whole is not handled
	- Seems this is related in the source code
		- If `false`, the propagation is stopped only if stopPropagation is called on either of the corresponding `SHORT_CUT_TRIGGERED` or `SHORTCUT_PREFIX` events.
		- The default value is `true`.
