- [[ARTICLE - ideas for DataScript 2]]

		- [[tonsky]] mentioned that he did not like *queries* and never used it in his work. How come?

		- The big question is: if you don't need queries (which I agree you don't), then why bother with DataScript at all? Why not just store your data in native Clojure/ClojureScript data structures, using the right structure for each thing and use a small number of data access functions, possibly maintaining an index or two?
		- This is what I did: migrated an app (arguably a fairly complex one) from DataScript to native Clojure data structures. Not because I didn't like DataScript: I actually liked the idea a lot, but because I couldn't justify the cost in performance and complexity (in my case, DataScript not handling nil values was a problem as well).
