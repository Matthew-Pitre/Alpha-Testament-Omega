- #[[Learning Clojure]] `defmulti` + `defmethod`
	- https://clojure.org/reference/multimethods
		- also introduces `derive`, `isa?`, `instance?`, `parents`, `ancestors`, `descendants` etc
	- It is a cool feature of Clojure on how it handles polymorphism using pattern matching
- `DragEvent` for handling drop events:
	- ```js
	        Array.from(e.dataTransfer.items).forEach(item => {
	          const type = item.type
	          item.getAsString(s => {
	            console.log(type, ":", s)
	          })
	        })
	  
	  ```

	- Goal: setting a GitHub action to automate publishing your Logseq graph to GitHub pages
	- Pre: GitHub Desktop, have a GitHub account
	- Scripts
		- In Logseq
			- Create a new graph in Logseq (user can also use an existing repo)
			- Turn on **publish all graphs**
			- Write something in a journal
		- GitHub Desktop
			- Use GitHub Desktop app to initialize a Git repo for this graph
			- Publish this repo to GitHub
		- Browser
			- Add a new GitHub action
			- Pasting the workflow file from knowledge-garden
			- Go to the actions page and see the result
			- Download the trace file to see how it is being automated
		- Talk about limitations
