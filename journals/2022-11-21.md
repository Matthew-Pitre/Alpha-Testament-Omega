	- FLIP (**F**irst, **L**ast, **I**nverse, **P**lay) approach to animate non-animatable properties
		- Is this pattern common in HTML related animation libraries like react-spring?
		- For Framer, it uses [popmotion](https://github.com/popmotion/popmotion) library
	- A side note on `React.useLayoutEffect`
		- When the callback in `React.useLayoutEffect` runs, it is runs after the virtual dom is applied to the real DOM, but before the browser paint, but **after** layout.
		- During this time, the `getClientBoundingRect` call will return the correct new layout values
		- this is why it is called the Layout effect
