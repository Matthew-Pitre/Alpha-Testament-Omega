- [[how tldraw works/canvas]]
	- tldraw uses plain HTML elements instead of `canvas` to draw shapes
		- The shapes live in "canvas" space
			- event handlers are bound to the shapes for various ux
			- every shape is wrapped by a shape container, which defines its position on the canvas; provide a new coordinated context layer for the inner
		- the canvas camera is the actual viewport of the canvas, but also has a zoom + positioning to adjust the actual view of the canvas
			- uses `transform: scale + translate` to change the camera
				- translate is negated
