- Worked on improving [[logseq query playground ui]]
	- I just realized that Clojure and ClojureScript libraries may not be compatible.
		- A JSON library `cheshire` is Clojure only, but not available to ClojureScript
		- I am using `cljs-bean` instead
	- DataScript Reverse Lookup https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query/pull.html#attribute-name-reverse-lookup-example
		- e.g., `{:block/_refs ...}` will get all blocks that referenced the current block
		- ```json
		  {
		    "block/uuid": {
		      "uuid": "6273cb3f-cbb1-41ad-bab3-0120bbe14cbe",
		      "__hash": null,
		      "cljs$lang$protocol_mask$partition0$": 2153775104,
		      "cljs$lang$protocol_mask$partition1$": 2048
		    },
		    "db/id": 17,
		    "block/_refs": [
		      {
		        "block/content": "NOW asdad [[May 3rd, 2022]]\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2022-05-02 Mon 22:58:16]\nCLOCK: [2022-05-03 Tue 17:38:44]\n:END:",
		        "block/left": {
		          "db/id": 25
		        },
		        "block/marker": "NOW",
		        "block/parent": {
		          "db/id": 22
		        },
		        "block/refs": [
		          {
		            "db/id": 4
		          },
		          {
		            "db/id": 17
		          }
		        ],
		        "block/uuid": {
		          "uuid": "6273ca7a-b9ff-4d46-8b82-fe3cdef63118",
		          "__hash": null,
		          "cljs$lang$protocol_mask$partition0$": 2153775104,

- [[Logseq with tldraw]]
	- The YouTube/CodeSandbox custom shape in the example looks interesting
		- requires mobx?
			- Yes. The core shape is dependent on it.
			- May need a quick mobx go through to understand the example codes
				- My first impression is that [[Mobx]] is similar to a reactive object. May be [[valtio]] is lighter?
		- implements
			- `ReactContextBar`
		- **Not interactive?**
			- prevented by pointer-events: none
			- may need a title bar to move it with ease? or **double click** to enable editing?
			- I guess in the first version it is ok to be read only
	- ClojureScript does not support `class ... extends` syntax. Maybe maintain the Logseq wrapper directly in JS?
	- #### **Initial thoughts on implementation**
		- get a quick implementation first without proper abstraction
		- using React.Portal + HTMLContainer to draw an anchor for Logseq to render into?
		- Thinking about context bar use case?
		- Persisting data into .tldr?
