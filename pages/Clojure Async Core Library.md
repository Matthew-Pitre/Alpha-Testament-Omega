- Seems that: since ClojureScript does not provide blocking on async, there is API for  `>!`  and  `<!` , but not  `<!!`  and  `>!!`
	- `>!`  and  `<!`  works in  `go`  blocks, but  `<!!`  will also work outside of go block
- the difference between  `go`  and  `thread` ?
	- `go`  uses a thread from the **thread pool** to do the work
	- `thread`  creates a new thread and returns a  `chan`
- buffered channel
	- put message into a full chan will block until another process takes out value from this chan
- Clojure’s core.async library was largely inspired by Go’s concurrency model, which is based on the work by Tony Hoare in Communicating Sequential Processes and is available at [http://www.usingcsp.com/](http://www.usingcsp.com/).

	- There are some nice looks diagrams
- We also have  `put!`  to put values into  `chan`  outside of go block
	- `put!`  does not park the process
	- we can use it in a event handler callback
	- the counterpart is  `take!`
- It looks to me that in order to achieve something like  `Promise.all` , we need to
- go-loop, mix and merge
