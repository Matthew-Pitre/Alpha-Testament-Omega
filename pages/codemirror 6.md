- [Start up guide](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/guide/#functional-core%2C-imperative-shell)
	- `EditorState`, `document`, `view`
	- Provide a `basic-setup` to quickly setup the baseline editor
	- ### "Functional Core, Imperative Shell"
		- ==document, state data structures **are immutable**==
			- direct changes to values will NOT have any effect
		- view component exposes imperative API
			- view's state is purely dependent on `EditorState`
			- state will get updated via transactions
	- ### Extension
		- provided as values to editor state
		- priority/precedence is determined by `Prec` and its ordering
		- document (`Text`) is indexed by lines
			- `let doc = Text.of(["line 1", "line 2", "line 3"])`
