- [Start up guide](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/guide/#functional-core%2C-imperative-shell)
  - `EditorState`, `document`, `view`
  - Provide a `basic-setup` to quickly setup the baseline editor
  - ### "Functional Core, Imperative Shell"
    - ==document, state data structures **are immutable**==
      - direct changes to values will NOT have any effect
    - view component exposes imperative API
      - view's state is purely dependent on `EditorState`
      - state will get updated via transactions
  - ### Extension
    - provided as values to editor state
    - priority/precedence is determined by `Prec` and its ordering
    - document (`Text`) is indexed by lines
      - `let doc = Text.of(["line 1", "line 2", "line 3"])`
    - Extensions could contribute different "Facet" of the state
      - https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state.Facet%5Edefine
  - ### Data Model
  - ### Transactions
    - created with state's update method
    - if reseting a state, the best way is to provide the a completely new state
  - Virtual rendering only the viewport
