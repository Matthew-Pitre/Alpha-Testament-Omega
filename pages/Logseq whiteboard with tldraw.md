- ## dev issues
  id:: 62793896-81b7-4a97-a5db-7ac22841fef8
	- tldraw uses class syntax for defining shapes and it makes defining shapes in Logseq code base not possible
	- current build process on a change
		- build `@tldraw/react` with `yarn` (build in postinstall script)
		- build `tldraw-logseq` (`yarn build` or `yarn dev`)
		- testing `tldraw-logseq` is a pain
			- started a pure js (vite) environment as a compliment to the cljs demo
		- once `tldraw-logseq` is ready, move the built assets to Logseq
		- watching mode for Logseq takes a looong time! Stuck in waiting for `remote-relay` socket connection :(
